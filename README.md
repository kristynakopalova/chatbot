# Frontend (React) Chat Interface with Mock AI Agent Challenge

## Overview

This challenge is designed to test your skills in building React (or React Native) applications, specifically focusing on creating a single-page chat interface where users can interact with a (mock) AI agent.
The AI agent will respond with predetermined texts to user inputs, simulating a basic conversational AI experience.

## Objective

Your task is to create a user-friendly chat interface that allows users to send messages and receive responses from the AI agent.
The core functionality will focus on the UI and basic interaction, with an optional feature to simulate the AI "thinking" (the time it takes for an AI agent to respond) for a more realistic user experience.

## Core Requirements

1. **Chat UI Layout:** Design and implement a chat interface with a clear distinction between user messages and AI responses. The interface should include:
   - A display area for the chat history.
   - A text input field for typing messages (Bonus: you can use any other input methods such as STT - Speech-to-Text).
   - A send button to submit messages.

2. **Mock AI Responses:** Implement functionality where the AI agent responds with a mocked-up (e.g., hardcoded) message following each user input. These responses should appear in the chat history alongside user messages.

3. **Responsiveness:** The chat interface should be responsive, providing a seamless experience across different devices and screen sizes.

## Optional Features (Bonus)

**Simulate AI "Thinking" Process:** Enhance the chat interaction by introducing a brief delay (e.g., 3-5 seconds) to simulate the AI agent "thinking" before displaying its response. Delays are inevitable for many real-life applications based on AI agents or LLMs. During this delay, show a temporary message or a visual indicator (e.g., "AI is thinking...") in the chat history. Replace this message/indicator with the AI's response afterward.

**Innovative UI Design for Chat with AI Agent**: We have many chat apps out there, but any creative ideas about the best ways for UI chat with an AI agent would be a big plus. 
Think outside the boxâ€”unconventional inputs, interactive elements, or ways to display chat history could all contribute to a unique user experience.

## Instructions

1. **Start with this Repository:** Start by using this repository to commit your code.

2. **Build the Chat Interface:** Implement the chat interface according to the core requirements outlined above. 
   - Technology: You should use at least either React.js or React Native for this project. However, feel free to use any additional libraries or tools that you find appropriate for the task.

3. **Implement Optional Features (If you choose):** If you're up for a challenge, try implementing the optional features to showcase your advanced skills. Or any other features that could be relevant.

4. **Submission:** Once you have completed the challenge, make sure all your changes are pushed to the repository. Share the link to your repository as your submission.

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Functionality:** Implementation of the core requirements.
- **Code Quality:** Clarity, readability, and organization of your code.
- **UI/UX Design:** The aesthetic appeal and usability of the chat interface.
- **Creativity and Problem-Solving:** Implementation of the optional features will be considered a plus.

## Getting Started

You can begin by cloning this repository locally. The project setup should include a basic React (or React Native) application structure. If you need to add any environment variables or additional setup instructions, please update the README accordingly.

Good luck, and we're looking forward to seeing your chat interface in action!
